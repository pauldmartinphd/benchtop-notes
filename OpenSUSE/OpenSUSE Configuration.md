# openSUSE integration notes

[Build Configuration](../Build%20Configuration.md) describes the active Tumbleweed/OBS build. This page records integration work and package candidates, including earlier material collected while evaluating Aeon and MicroOS.

## Areas needing integration work

* RAID
* Disk Partitioning
* ZFS
* Cryptography
* Remote Management
* Automatic Disk Unlock

## Kernel support to verify in the image

* NVIDIA Module
* Binder and ASHMEM Modules (for Waydroid)
* ZFS Module
* 1000 Hz tick rate (a kernel build setting, not a module)

## OBS Packages

* system76-scheduler
* adw-gtk3
* pipewire-nonfree-codecs
* dislocker

## Application and integration candidates

The original list grouped these under Flatpak, but their delivery method is not established. Waydroid and desktop integration components in particular need checking against the image design.

* Waydroid:

## Zypper: Automatically Remove Orphaned Packages

By default, zypper does not remove orphaned dependencies when you remove a package. To enable automatic cleanup:

##### /etc/zypp/zypp.conf

    solver.cleandepsOnRemove = true

Alternatively, manually clean orphans:

    sudo zypper packages --orphaned
    sudo zypper remove --clean-deps <package>
