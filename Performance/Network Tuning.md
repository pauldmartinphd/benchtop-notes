# Network tuning

The selected configuration remains CUBIC with fq_codel, as recorded in the September 16 correction.

## TCP Congestion Control

### /etc/sysctl.d/40-network.conf

    #Select TCP CUBIC congestion control algorithm for LAN
	net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = cubic
	net.core.default_qdisc = fq_codel

	# Ubisoft fix from Universal Blue
     net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 1

### Alternative to evaluate

BBR/BBRv3 was listed as an alternative for lossy or high-latency connections, with CachyOS as a reference. The notes contain no controlled comparison establishing that it would improve Benchtop’s workloads. Keep it separate from the selected CUBIC setting.

The earlier BBR experiment used this pair; it is not an instruction to replace the default:

    net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
    net.core.default_qdisc = fq

## DNS

### /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf

	[main]
	dns=systemd-resolved
